### P1: The Stroop Effect

> Simple statistical analysis on the phenomemon known as the Stroop effect. Hypothesis testing, basic data graphs applied using Python libraries pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.
  
  
### P2: Baseball Career Arc

> The project is motivated by PECOTA, a sophisticated method of forecasting player output for the upcoming season by Nate Silver in 2003. This study looks at batter performance trends as a function of player age. Batter performance is determined by On-Base-Percentage, or OBP, a popular metric in measuring batter value.

> The result is a performance curve that increases and peaks at age 27 and decreases from there on. The curve has the appearance of an arc due to a decrease in performance velocity over time that is the consequence of negative performance acceleration.
  
  
### P3: Data Wrangling of Singapore Map Data

> According to Wikipedia, every building in Singapore is given its unique postcode. Any piece of imperfect address information that can be linked to its actual postcode has the potential to have perfect address information. An online database consisting of 124,285 unique postcodes with complete address information was parsed. The quest for perfect addresses begin.
  
  
### P4: Exploratory data analysis of NBA Basketball State of Possession

> The state of possession is defined as how an offensive possession begins. Such information is important, and can help uncover team and player strengths and weaknesses that are typically overlooked by analysts. Twenty various graphs were drawn in R's ggplot2, and the insight it contributes were thoroughly discussed.
  
  
### P5: Identifying Persons of Interest at Enron Using Emails and Financial Data

> In one of the most infamous US corporate scandals in recent memory, Enron email corpus and financial details were pubalically released, the use of supervised classification algorithms SVM and Naive Bayes were used in the identification of guilty persons.

> The findings showed that SVM exhibits stronger aggression as it captured more true positives at 1364 to NB's 681, but at the cost of 2965 false positives to NB's 934. Therefore, it had a strong performance in recall but weak performance in precision.
  
  
### P6: Make Effective Data Visualization

> Find my Air Jordan, the search-query-dataviz webapp allows the user to find their favorite pair of Nike Air Jordans and understand its current eBay market by an interactive scatterplot. The user is able to quickly distinguish the offerings available by price, size and condition. Click on legend dials to filter by condition.
